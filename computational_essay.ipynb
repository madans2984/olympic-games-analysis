We also used corresponding population and GDP per capita data from Wikipedia. Wikipedia has population data from the United Status Census Bureau for every 5 years, so since the Summer Olympics occur every 4 years, we used the closest year's population data. Our GDP per capita data comes from the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) yearly estimates based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) from Wikipedia as well.\n",

In `helpers.py`, we use the function `table_scrape`, which takes in the url of a Wikipedia page and returns, by default, the first table of the page.
